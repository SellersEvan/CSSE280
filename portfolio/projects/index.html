                <p>
                    Between three startups, I have worked on many projects.
                    Taking projects from idea to launch has taught me a lot
                    about many industries and tools. With this knowledge, I
                    hope to continue learning and help push these
                    industries forward.

                  <h2>Aris Weapon Detection</h2>
                  <p>
                    Aris Weapon Detection is a software security suite that has
                    been years in the making, and still in beta testing. The
                    weapon detection software was designed to be implemented
                    in schools and other facilities to act as a pre-warning
                    system when weapons are detected on security cameras. It
                    has taught me a lot about software and customer relationship.

                    <h2>Mask Detection</h2>
                    <p>
                        During the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, I
                        designed a simple open-source mask detection software.
                        Checking to ensure everyone was wearing a face mask,
                        the system could alert building admins if it detected
                        someone not wearing a mask.

                    <h2>Synthetic Data Research</h2>
                    <p>
                        While developing many artificial intelligence-based
                        applications, I started to toy around with the idea of
                        synthetic data. This is the process of using computers
                        to generate images to train AI networks. In the end,
                        this process was much faster but did not lead to as
                        accurate AI networks.

                    <h2>Infinity Holographic Display</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Infinity Holographic display was a 3D display box
                        that allowed users to use 3-dimensional applications.
                        Not only was it a complex and technical hardware
                        project, but its software was also incredibly complex.
                        During the project, I learned a lot about 3D graphics
                        programming and designing development tools for other
                        developers.

                    <p>
                        The Bookmark manager was a simple read-later
                        application that allowed you to save links from a
                        browser extension to specific folders with notes about
                        the link. You could then organize and see your
                        bookmarks from the web dashboard. This project taught
                        me a lot about taking a product from idea to launch and
                        taught me the value of lean and agile business
                        practices and the importance of user feedback and data.

                    <p>
                        A simple NodeJS and electron note application that
                        stored your notes locally on your computer. Designing
                        an easy and user-friendly UI was the most challenging
                        part of this project. Additionally, I learned how to
                        package applications for different platforms like
                        windows and mac.

                    <p>
                        The Evolve Bootable USB was a bootable drive with a
                        custom-built operating system designed by myself. The
                        operating system was based on Linux and had special
                        speed features to make it work well off a USB Stick,
                        and allowed you to access your files from the device
                        without booting to the operating system.

                        The tactical flashlight was my modern design to
                        redesign the flashlight for the 21st century. I
                        learned a lot about user design and engineering
                        during the process of the project.
